# 3D Point Operations
This program defines a 3D point class and implements methods for projecting, rotating, and shifting points in 3D space.
# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
This code requires a C++ compiler and the iostream and cmath libraries.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/K0sm4/3D_Point_Operations.git

```
2. Compile the code:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main

```
3. Run the program:
```bash
./main

```
# Usage
After running the program, the user is prompted to select an operation and provide relevant parameters. The available operations are:

* Projection: project a point onto a plane defined by an equation in the form ax + by + cz + d = 0.

* Rotation: rotate a point around one of the coordinate axes by a specified angle.

* Translation: shift a point along one of the coordinate axes by a specified distance.
